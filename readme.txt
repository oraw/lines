On a 9x9 board (default size), 3 balls of different colors appear each move (seven colors in total).

You need to make lines of the same color in five or more pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally (hence the original name Lines - Lines).

Only one ball can be moved in one move and the path between the start and end positions must be clear.

A path is considered free if it consists of one or more movements of the ball one square vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.

If, after moving the ball, a line of the same color with a length of 5 or more balls is formed, then it is destroyed, the player is awarded points (10 for 5 balls, 12 for 6, 18 for 7, 28 for 8, 42 for 9) and the appearance of the next three balls is postponed until next move.

The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible and hold out as many moves as possible.

To move the ball, you must first click on the selected ball (the ball starts "jumping" in the cell), and then on the cell where you want to move it.
If the ball cannot be moved, a corresponding message will appear at the bottom of the playing field.

There are also game options with different field sizes and the number of balls lined up.
